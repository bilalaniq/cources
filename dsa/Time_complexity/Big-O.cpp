// ------------------------------BIG-O------------------------
/*
why we use Big-O notation or time complexity is wheather decide if to use an particular data structure/ algoritham or not
because some algoritams in some snerios are more performant while in other cases they can be ill-performant so this is decided by the big-O
or time complexity

the bigger your input grows the bigger
