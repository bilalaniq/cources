// -----------------------------binary to decimal------------------------------
/*
-------------------------------positive no---------------------------
to convert the binary no to deciml follow the following steps
1. Write down the binary number
2. Label each bit with its corresponding power of 2

lets take an example 13 
which is 1101 in binary 
1   1   0   1
2^3 2^2 2^1 2^0

3. Multiply each bit by its corresponding power of 2:

1 × 2^3 = 1 × 8 = 8
1 × 2^2 = 1 × 4 = 4
0 × 2^1 = 0 × 2 = 0
1 × 2^0 = 1 × 1 = 1

4. Add up the results: Now, add all the values:

8 + 4 + 0 + 1 = 13

The binary number 1101 equals 13 in decimal.

-------------------------------negative no---------------------------
converting an negative binary no to decimal is quite dificult there are many ways to do it
1. Two's complement 
2. Sign and magnitude and one's complement
3. Excess-K
